# BloodBridge

A comprehensive platform designed for community welfare and fundraising, enabling users to create, manage, and participate in donation campaigns. This project also facilitates lost and found item management, allowing users to post, browse, and recover lost belongings effectively.

## Features for Your Project  

### üåü Core Functionalities:
- **User Role Management**:
  - **Admin üåê**: Full control of the platform, including user management, donation requests, funding, and content publishing.
  - **Donor ü©∏**: Ability to register, view donation requests, respond to requests, and manage their own profiles.
  - **Volunteer ü§ù**: Permission to create and manage donation requests. Volunteers can update the status of blood donation requests.
  - üí° *Admins can assign roles (e.g., Volunteer, Admin) or block users directly from the database.*

### üîí User Authentication:
- **Registration**:
  - Users can register with their email, name, avatar (via imageBB), blood group, district, upazila, and password. By default, every registered user becomes a "Donor."
  - **Default User Status**: Active.
  - Admins can block/unblock users, which updates their status accordingly.
- **Login**: Secure login with email and password. Social login is not required.
  
### üîë Private Dashboard:
- **Profile Management**:
  - Users can view and edit their profile data, except for their email, which remains static.
  - Admins can manage all users, while donors and volunteers manage only their own data.

#### Donor-Specific Features:
- **Recent Donation Requests**: Donors can view their top three recent requests on the dashboard homepage.
- **Full Donation History**: Paginated view of all donation requests with filtering options (`pending`, `in-progress`, `done`, `canceled`).

  *Note: Only active donors can create requests.*

  - Publish/unpublish blogs, edit and delete content, or add new blogs through a rich text editor.

#### Volunteer-Specific Features:
- **Request Management**:
  - Volunteers can only update the statuses of donation requests (e.g., from "pending" to "in-progress").
- **Content Contribution**:
  - Volunteers can add blogs but cannot publish or delete content.

### üåê Public Pages:

### üìÖ Additional Features:
- **Pagination**:
  - Implemented across all tables and lists (e.g., user management, donation requests, and funding records).
- **Sorting & Filtering**:
  - Sorting by date, status, or categories to ensure streamlined navigation.
